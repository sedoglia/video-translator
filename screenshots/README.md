## How to Add the Interface Screenshot

Please save your screenshot as `interface.png` in this directory.

The screenshot should show:
- Video Source selection (Local File/YouTube URL tabs)
- Language Configuration (Source/Target language dropdowns)
- Processing Options (GPU CUDA checkbox with GPU detection)
- Output Directory selector
- Process Video button
- Progress section
- Logs area

Once you save the screenshot here as `interface.png`, it will automatically appear in both README.md and README.it.md files.
